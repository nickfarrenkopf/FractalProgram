Hello! Welcome to the Fractal Program!

This program allows the user to create a variety of fractals.
In later editions, the user will be able to change conditoins of iteration.
This is an ongoing project, so bear with me if things aren't nicely done/don't work.

Note 1: This was one of my first programs, so many of the algorithms in here can definitely be improved. Plus the code is often 
sloppy and not commented well. I have other things I am wanting to work on currently, so I will address these issues at a later date.
For now, the program does the simple things I want it to.
